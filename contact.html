      <div class="panel">
        <p>If you cannot find the exact vehicle you are looking for listed on our 
          website, do not worry. We have a dedicated team of experts who will be 
          able to put you in touch with a dealer who will sell you the car at What 
          Car?'s Target Price or less. Simply fill out the contact form on the 
          website and we will put you in touch with the dealer who is relevant to 
          your purchase.

      <button class="accordion">What happens when I see an offer I like?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>When you view an offer that is right for you, you can contact the dealer
          yourself, or fill in our contact form which will allow the dealer to 
          contact you by phone or by email - you can choose either method at the 
          Contact Dealer stage.

      <button class="accordion">Do I receive a warranty with my purchase?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Yes. Our car buying service puts you in touch with manufacturer-approved
          franchised dealers. This means that, when a sale is completed, you will 
          receive the same UK-wide warranty as if you had visited the dealer in 
          the showroom.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">When do I pay for my vehicle?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Your dealer will ask you to pay an up-front deposit when you confirm 
          that you intend to purchase the car. This will reserve your vehicle and
          enable the dealer to send through the relevant production notes to the
          manufacturer. If you are purchasing your car using a finance plan, 
          youâ€™ll start paying your monthly payment upon delivery of your vehicle. 
          If you are making a full cash payment up front for your car, the balance
          of payment will be made upon delivery of your new vehicle.
